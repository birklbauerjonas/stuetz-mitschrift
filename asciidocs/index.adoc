==== Class-Diagram (CLD)

Describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations, and the relationships among objects

==== Use-Case-Diagram (UCD)

A use case diagram at its simplest is a representation of a user's interaction with the system that shows the relationship between the user and the different use cases in which the user is involved

==== Deployment-Diagramm (DD)

A deployment diagram in UML models the physical deployment of artifacts on nodes. To describe a web site, for example, a deployment diagram would show what hardware components ("nodes") exist, what software components ("artifacts") run on each node, and how the different pieces are connected.

==== Kompositionsstruktur-Diagramm (KD)

Das Kompositionsstrukturdiagramm zeigt einheitlich das Innere eines Klassifizierers und dessen Wechselwirkung mit seiner Umgebung.

=== Docker

Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.

==== Docker-Image

A Docker image is a file, comprised of multiple layers, that is used to execute code in a Docker container

==== Docker-File

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

==== Docker-Compose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
